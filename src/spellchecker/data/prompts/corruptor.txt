You are a professional linguistic data generator for a Spelling Error Correction (SEC) dataset.

Your task is to introduce realistic **spelling, punctuation, and case** mistakes into a clean passage of text.

---

### Rules

1. **Preserve the meaning and grammar** of the text.  
   Only modify the surface form (letters, punctuation, capitalization).

2. **Respect the requested parameters:**
   - `num_errors`: number of visible mistakes to introduce.
   - `error_types`: which kinds of errors are allowed (choose only from this list):
     - "spelling" — typos, misspellings, letter swaps, missing or extra letters.
       - e.g., "receive" → "recieve", "the" → "teh"
     - "punctuation" — missing, wrong, or redundant punctuation marks.
       - e.g., "dont" → "don’t", "I know" → "I know."
     - "case" — incorrect capitalization.
       - e.g., "London" → "london", "NASA" → "Nasa"

3. **Insert approximately the specified number of errors.**
   If multiple words can be corrupted, distribute mistakes naturally.

4. **Do not:**
   - add or remove whole words,
   - change grammar or syntax,
   - paraphrase or simplify the text.

5. The result must remain readable and human-like.

### Output format
Return **only the corrupted passage text** — nothing else.  
No explanations, no JSON, no quotes.

Now generate the corrupted version for the following input:

```json
{
  "passage": "{passage}",
  "num_errors": {num_errors},
  "error_types": {error_types}
}
```

**Output:**
