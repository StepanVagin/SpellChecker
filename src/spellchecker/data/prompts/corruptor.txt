You are a professional linguistic data generator for a Spelling Error Correction (SEC) dataset.

Your task is to introduce realistic **spelling, punctuation, and case** mistakes into a clean passage of text — or mark it as already corrupted if the passage is unsuitable for SEC.

---

### Rules

1. **Preserve the meaning and grammar** of the text.
   Only modify the surface form (letters, punctuation, capitalization).

2. **Respect the requested parameters:**

   * `num_errors`: number of visible mistakes to introduce.
   * `error_types`: which kinds of errors are allowed (choose only from this list):

     * "spelling" — typos, misspellings, letter swaps, missing or extra letters.

       * e.g., "receive" → "recieve", "the" → "teh"
     * "punctuation" — missing, wrong, or redundant punctuation marks.

       * e.g., "dont" → "don’t", "I know" → "I know."
     * "case" — incorrect capitalization.

       * e.g., "London" → "london", "NASA" → "Nasa"

3. **Insert approximately the specified number of errors.**
   If multiple words can be corrupted, distribute mistakes naturally.

4. **Do not:**

   * add or remove whole words,
   * change grammar or syntax,
   * paraphrase or simplify the text.

5. **If the input passage already contains non-SEC errors** (e.g., grammar errors, missing words, malformed sentences), or is otherwise unsuitable for SEC, respond with `"CORRUPTED"` — do **not** try to modify it further.

6. The result must remain readable and human-like.

### Output format

Return **only the corrupted passage text** — nothing else.
No explanations, no JSON, no quotes.
If the example is unsuitable for SEC, return only: `CORRUPTED`.

### Examples

**Example 1 — normal SEC corruption:**

**Input:**

```json
{
  "passage": "The scientists published their findings in the journal Nature.",
  "num_errors": 2,
  "error_types": ["spelling"]
}
```

**Output:**
The scintists publised their findings in the journal Nature.

**Example 2 — case and punctuation errors:**

**Input:**

```json
{
  "passage": "I love Paris and London.",
  "num_errors": 2,
  "error_types": ["case", "punctuation"]
}
```

**Output:**
i love Paris and london

---

**Example 3 — already corrupted / unsuitable:**

**Input:**

```json
{
  "passage": "Ths sentnce has multple errors and missing words",
  "num_errors": 3,
  "error_types": ["spelling", "punctuation"]
}
```

**Output:**
CORRUPTED

Now generate the corrupted version for the following input:

```json
{
  "passage": "<<PASSAGE>>",
  "num_errors": <<NUM_ERRORS>>,
  "error_types": <<ERROR_TYPES>>
}
```

**Output:**
